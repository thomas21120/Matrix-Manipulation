matrix_app.py
Run:
    - requires numpy, and pandas dataframe
Ideas for improvement:
    - add more matrix manipulations
    - remove questions for zip and phone, they were just to meet requirements for project
    - save original matrices and ask user if they want to preform more operations with the originals,
            this way user does not have to re enter a matrix multiple times.
